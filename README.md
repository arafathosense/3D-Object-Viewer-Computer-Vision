# 3D Object Viewer Computer Vision

**Creator: arafathosense**

**About this project**

gesture_3d_viewer.py is a small, lightweight Python viewer for exploring 3D gesture recordings and simple 3D objects. Use it to quickly preview, rotate, zoom, and inspect gesture trajectories or 3D models while developing algorithms or preparing demos. It's aimed at researchers and developers who need a no-frills visualizer for gesture and 3D data.

**Key features**

    Simple viewer for 3D gestures and objects (rotate, pan, zoom).
    Works as a development tool for inspecting recorded gesture trajectories.
    Minimal, script-based entrypoint (gesture_3d_viewer.py) so you can adapt it to your data pipeline.

**Supported data (typical)**

    Gesture time-series (custom formats — inspect gesture_3d_viewer.py for exact input handling).
    Common 3D object files (examples: .obj, .ply) if the script loads models — check the script for explicit support.

**🧠 Installation & Setup Guide**

**Step 1:** Download the source code from this repository and open the folder in PyCharm.

**Step 2:** Open the terminal, **copy all pip,** and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

            pip install numpy, open3d trimesh pyglet matplotlib openGL pyrr

            
**Step 3:** Wait until all installations are completed successfully. Then, run the program and see your result!
